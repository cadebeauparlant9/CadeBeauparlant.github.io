<p><H2><b> Freshman Year </b></H2></p>
<p> I went into freshman year confident in my abilities to make the team and play, I came from a skilled youth hockey experience and the only real factor against me ath this point was size and age. Try outs were usually within the first week or so after Thanksgiving and there was usually lots of off-ice prep leading up to it. Try-outs were always a drag but feshman year was the worst due to me inexperience with "highschool" hockey. But, I made the team and played through the entire you on 2nd line while playing on the penalty kill. I scored 7 goals and had 13 assists on the year and solidified my spot for next year.</p>

<p> Sophomore year was a pretty big improvement off of Freshman year. I had gained lots of weight and played at a lot of summer recruiting tournaments and camps in order to improve myself. This had lots of positive results, I played first line and scored 13 goals and 19 assists, double the goals I had the last year. I ended recieiving a concussion the third game in but this only resulted in me missing three more games. We ended up losing first round of play offs and it was onto the next year.</p>

<p> This was by far my best year, I had come into the year so confident because I was gettin looks from PG schools and I was at my peak physical fitness. This was also our teams best year, we made it to semi-finals before losing 1-0 to Winchester, 1 game before the TD Garden D1 State Finals. I scored 26 goals this year and 18 assists, amounting to my best points totaled in a year. I got a lot of looks during the season and was asked to play at some exclusive camps and tournaments around New England.</p>

<p> Senior year summer I attened a private camp and BU and played in the A-Division for Hockey Night in Boston, I went to National Camp and tryouts and ended my summer hockey with comitting to New Hampton Prep, ready to further my academic and athletic career. In August while pursuing my Mountain biking hobby I tore my AC Joint, grade 5, and attempted to rehab it for 3 months before trying to play. Unfortnately I ended up tearing my labrym aswell about 7 games in and was out the rest of the season and was required to miss lacrosse and get surgery, I lost my scholarship and had to decommitt because I was unable to play the following year either.</p>

<p><H2><b> Growing Up </b></H2></p>

<p><body> I was born at Mass. General Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts on February 12, 2001. I originally grew up in a small town called Amesbury in the north-eastern part of MA. and had moved a couple times but stayed in that town. I made lots of friends throughout elementary school, and stayed at Amesbury Middle School until the end of 6th grade. I then moved a town over to the small coastal city called Newburyport. I finished the rest of my middle schools at Newburyport and proceeded to attend Newburyport Highschool which contained just under 1000 kids. After graduating Newburyport Highschool with some athletic and academic accolades I decided to further my academic career at the University of Maine Orono as Business Major with management as concentration.</body></p>

<p><H2><b> Hobbies </b></H2></p>

<p><body> I grew up playing hockey my whole life. I learned to skate just after I learned to walk. I played for my town team for 2 years so I could learn the game a little bit. After my dad figured there was somewhere better for me he signed me for the Valley Jr. Warriors, a travel team that had tryouts and multiple teams and travled far for tournaments, a pretty big deal. I played that for yeas, all the way until about 7th grade before switching to the Boston Jr. Rangers because of a bad coaching siutation at the team before. I played for them all the way up until highschool where I was faced with decision of juniors, private school, or my home school. I didn't want to play juniors, and I had the opportunity to play for a prep school but my dad and uncle insisted I stayed and played with my friends, most of whom ended up leaving anyways. I was a varsity 1st/2nd line player for 4 years, all-league/all-star player, and was ready to play at PG school in attempt to play college until I had a very serious injury while enjoying my other favorite hobby, mountain biking. Now, before I get into that I will clarify the other sports I played in highschool. I played goalie in lacrosse, captain junior and senior year (although out senior year) and I played football my freshman year and sophomore year before hockey consumed my fall season as well.</body></p>

<p><body>I picked up the mountain biking hobby in 8th grade and somehow convinced my parents to go along with it and buy me an 1800 dollar bike in order to pursue this crazy hobby. I started racing downhill at various mountain bike parks all over New England and managed to accomplish some pretty amazing things. My biggest accomplishment was the Pink Bike drop at Highland Mountain Bike Park, a 13 ft drop leading into a massive 20ft or so table, although there have been better and more astonishing things ive done that one is the most memorable to me. Last August I was riding for one of the last times of the season and decided to do my favorite run which consisted of some nasty features. After overshooting the drop on Tombstone I carried to much speed into the double that laid ahead and overrotated the bike resulting in me going over the handle bars. I had torn my labrym and AC joint in my shoulder and later found out I needed serious surgery and rehab that would make me miss both hockey and lacrosse and would result in a 10 month recovery period after surgery. I had also broken my bike during the crash, the front of the fram snapped clean. So, this year I had bought a new bike in anticipation that I'd be ready to bike agian only to realie I would have to wait until next year to resume. Good thing is, I've gotten a couple of my buddies to want to come try it with me now.</body></p>

<p><H2> Aspirations for the Future </H2></p>

<p><body> Ive always wanted to be that wealthy business man you see in the movies, living the life, not to many worries. But, I've also realized that most of the time the steps to get there can be boring, and tidious, and take a super long time. Throughout my educational career I have learned alot, especially about the idea of entrepreanurship. Running my own business has always appealed to me, I can have fun yet still work hard and I dont have people barking down my throat. I can also choose which product I'd prefer to adhere to. Im excited at the idea that I only have 3 more years until I finally make the groundbreaking decision. I know for a fact that I want to start my own dispensary and eventually grow operation. But its also not that realistic to assume Ill be running that righ out of school. So, I plan to work all summer to save money and work after college for about 2 years before figuring out the start up costs and purchasing my selll license. I want to open my own chain dispensary across the country and once I start pulling in enough revenue began to grow for my own dispensaries. I hope to retire at a somewhat early age and raise one or two wonderful kids with a beautiful wife. In all honesty, living in the mountains wouldnt be to bad either.</body></p>

<p><H2><b> Overview </b></H2></p>
<p> When I graduate from school I hope to open a dispensary. Seeing the recent push for the legalization of the drug made me very excited to possibly be able to be a part of the growing industry, its already genereating millions of dollars per year and has yet to even be federally legalized! Within the few years after my graduation I have I hopes in the federal legalization which would allow my business to strive in the new market. I plan to first open a dispensary buying weed from bigger producers and then selling that for profit and once I make enough money I hope to be able to become self sufficient. I woud like to include a lounge with a cafe for customers to to smoke and chill out and buy some snacks and drinks, all THC infused.</p>

<p><H3><b> Cafe </b></H3></p>
<p><IMG SRC="https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/cafe-1-ht-er-191001_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"></p>
<p> The idea of the cafe is to be able to provide both edibles and liquids infused with THC at the highest quality and lowest prices possible, we want people to feel like the dispensary is inviting and not just a business transaction. We want to help you meet new people and build good realationships through the experience of our products and make you want to come back for more, we are more than just a normal dispensary.</p>
<p><H3><b> Show Room </b></H3></p>

<p> The show room will allow people to get first person access to the actual operation of the business. It allows us to build a sense of trust and gives the customer the satisfaction of knowing how their product is grown and accumulated. It's also a pretty exilerating experience to see such an overwhelming amount and the details of how it's done.</p>
<p><H3><b> Dispensary </b></H3></p>
<p><IMG SRC="https://sswlv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/inside-dispensary-900x450.jpg"></p>
<p> We want to have a sleek modern look to the dispensary while also not appearing to be an unafforadble high end store. We want products on display and at a reasonable price. We plan to sell each and every way and type of smoking at the store at the best price around. We will include both local and exotic strains and have more than enough options for you to choose from each time you visit.</p>
<p><H3><b> Boof Bus </b></H3></p>

<p> So obviously I don't quite have a picture of the Boof Bus yet so I had to pull the "cannibus" from online. We REALLY want to push this Boof Bus concept mainly because it hasnt really been nitched in yet and this will for sure be a money grabber. Think about how many people would love a joint or an 1/8 on their commute home or their lunch break or walking around the park, I know for a fact that A LOT of them would. There is a large consumer market waiting to come out.</p>
